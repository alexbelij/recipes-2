# Recipes

Recipes for food that I cook. Generally these are pretty spicy, and some can be quite hot as well. 

This repo is an attempt at publishing more often, in a less polished/"blog ready" format, to resolve the issue of me continually forgetting the recipe I use for butter chicken, or samosa filling, and having to search months of chrome history to find what I maybe used...

These recipes are broken up into the following rough categories (so far):

* [breakfast](breakfast/)
* [curries](curries/)
* [preserves](preserves/)
* [sauces](sauces/)
* [soups](soups/)
