# Theo's Recipes

Recipes for food that I cook. Generally these are pretty spicy, and some can be quite hot as well.

This repo is an attempt at publishing more often, in a less polished/"blog ready" format, to resolve the issue of me continually forgetting the recipe I use for butter chicken, or samosa filling, and having to search months of chrome history to find what I maybe used...

These recipes are broken up into the following rough categories (so far):

* [Appetizers](appetizers/)
* [Breakfast](breakfast/)
* [Curries](curries/)
* [Doughs](doughs/)
* [Instant Pot Specific](instant_pot/)
* [Preserves](preserves/)
* [Sauces](sauces/)
* [Soups](soups/)
