### The Weather

This is my own take on butter chicken. It uses some elements of other dishes I really enjoy, and is spicier than what you'd get in a restaurant.

When doing the butter chicken in the instant pot, I tend to use much larger chunks of chicken. Then I just hit it a few times with a wooden spoon in the bowl after so that it gets all the spices mixed up, and also ends up being kind of "pulled" . I usually add the cooking liquid to the bowl to keep it from drying out as well.

Pairs well with basmati rice.

### Variations

* Heavy (whipping) cream is fine, as is half-and-half cream
* Cream can be replaced with coconut cream
