This is my own take on butter chicken. It uses some elements of other dishes I really enjoy, and is spicier than what you'd get in a restaurant.

Pairs well with basmati rice.

Variations:

* As mentioned, cream can be replaced with coconut cream
* cook the chicken in the instant pot, and do the simmering under pressure in the instant pot
