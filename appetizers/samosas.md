## Ingredients

* 2 pounds potatoes, pealed
* 1 TBSP butter
* 1 cup frozen peas, corn, and carrots
* Flour for workspace
* Seasonings:
  * 1/2 TSP garam masala
  * 1/2 TSP chili powder
  * 1/2 TSP turmeric

## Instructions

1. Make the dough listed in doughs/samosa-wrappers and let it rest while making the filling.
2. Cook the potatoes until soft by boiling in water, or in an instant pot. Drain.
3. Add seasonings, and butter to potatoes, and mash potatoes.
4. Add frozen vegetables to potato mixture and gently combine.
5. To form a samosa:
  * Take a small ball of dough and roll it out as thinly as possible (much like hand-made pasta, the thinner the better). This should result in a circle about 6 inches across. Cut this in half, choosing the most narrow location of the circle.
  * Press the two un-cut sides together using some water on one side to bond the dough, add 2 TBSP filling, and then seal the remaining (cut) edge. Set Aside.
6. In a pot of pre-heated 350F oil, cook 3-4 samosas at a time, flipping in the middle, until the outsides are browned. This takes 2-4 minutes. OR. Cook in air fryer.
